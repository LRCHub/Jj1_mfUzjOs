Sun slide a picture
Sand down my mind
Memory obscured in the rough
Limbs all a-kilter
Punch through the earth
Grasping for clues in the dust

What was it I said
When I was high
I know it shook you
Feeling forgetful now

We are the undead
We are the undead

The glass in my sinus
The jazz under my nails
I'm stuffed up with crude souveniers

What was it I said
When I was high
I know I kissed you
Soft as a feather

We are the undead
We are the undead

I wonder will ever you ever recollect
The thing that I said

I wonder will you ever recollect
The thing that I said
(The thing that I said)
(We are the undead)

I'll play the hangman spell
String together words until
One letter left in the loop
I love you
And I think I did
Words hanging heavy
'Cause we are the undead
We are the undead
We are the undead
We are the undead

I wonder will you ever recollect
The thing that I said

I wonder will you ever recollect
The thing that I said
(The thing that I said)
(We are the undead)
