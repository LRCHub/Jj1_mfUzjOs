[00:42.53] Cascaded darkness, walls close in on me
[00:47.08] Nailed shut but my eyes still see
[00:51.45] Severe anguish as my body evolves
[00:55.69] The pain of life after death it resolves
[01:15.69] 
[01:15.94] Emptiness in twilight's rebirth
[01:20.59] The faint sounds of shoveled earth
[01:24.57] Madness growing as your mind dissolves
[01:29.08] Merely secret in my dreams
[01:42.08] 
[01:39.58] Night grows cold, twilight's near
[01:42.20] On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared
[01:44.53] Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass, no spared breath
[01:48.77] Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode
[01:52.66] Dead soul, stone cold, out into the night
[02:13.16] 
[01:57.16] Voices inside my head hold me under
[02:01.31] Voices oppress like roaring thunder
[02:05.74] An echo bouncing inside my brain
[02:09.62] How much can I take of the pain?
[02:14.57] The pain!
[02:19.07] 
[02:22.31] A war raging deep inside my head
[02:26.66] A split decision that will end with me dead
[02:30.68] You see the agony in my eyes
[02:34.83] Protruding aimless, I think it's time to...
[02:43.19] Die!
[02:45.19] 
[02:56.75] A cannibal's desire feeds the fire that burns in your head
[03:25.75] 
[03:04.96] Intense pain eats away at your brain
[03:07.31] Thorazine pumping through your veins
[03:25.31] 
[03:13.58] Death walks inside you, smell death around you
[03:15.97] Hell's evil spell takes a soul
[03:18.09] Hear the sound of the bell counting off death tolls
[03:43.59] 
[03:26.51] Laughing as you eternally rot
[03:29.00] Searching for human flesh and life's blood
[03:50.00] 
[03:40.42] Live undead
[03:47.19] Dead!
